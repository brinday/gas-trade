## Summary
Natural gas plays a key role in many energy systems today and understanding its future evolution is critical in the context of long-term energy system transitions. This study analyzes the long-term evolution of global natural gas trade and associated infrastructure by explicitly representing traded pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), a global multi-sectoral model. We then study their future evolution under a range of scenarios representing alternative economy-wide transitions, trade infrastructure, and trade barriers. Both traded LNG and pipeline gas may grow by mid-century, with traded LNG making up a dominant share, as it can be flexibly shipped over widespread regions. Cumulative global investments in LNG and pipeline infrastructure range from 230-1460 million tons per annum (MTPA) by 2050 across scenarios; the lower end of this range is achieved through transitioning to a low-carbon energy system along with limited trade.
